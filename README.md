Deep Learning Assignment 1   Dhamodharan CS24M027

This submission consists of two key files for my DA6401 Deep Learning assignment.

 It includes two key files: one for running hyperparameter sweeps to experiment with different configurations and another for executing the model using default parameters. 
 After conducting the sweeps, I ran the model with default parameters using a command-line argument in the train.py file, ensuring a controlled comparison of results.

**Steps to execute train.py file**

I executed the saved train.py file locally in the windows cmd

1 . Go to cmd and navigate to the file location 
2 . We can run the train.py in multiple ways if we just run train.py it will use the default parameters to execue with the project name **CS24M027_Deep_Learning_Assignment_1** and the sweep name **CS24M027**
3 . We can additionaly run it with the different parameters as we wish accordingly

**This was screenshot from my CMD in my laptop this was one way to run train.py**
